Repository for CIC - PCUBED Summer Research Program with Dr. Doina Bein

# Goal of Our Pairs Trading Project
The goal of our project is to analyze two cointegrated stocks and determine if there is _sufficient_ evidence of opportunity to exercise pairs trading practices to reap a profit over a period of one year

# Resources Utilized
1. Read articles on pairs trading, mathematical concepts utilized, and other necessary finance topics/terms
Become familiar with stocks, various sectors of the stock market in which two stocks may be correlated, and financial data of the stocks 
2. Practice simple algorithms that utilize the various data sets to be used for the project
   - Mean, Range, IQR, Standard Deviation, Pairs Trading Signal, Correlation, and Cointegration
3. Analyzed the stocks [Lenovo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LNVGF/history/?period1=1686614400&period2=1718236800) & [Motorola](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSI/history/?period1=1686614400&period2=1718236800) from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com) over a period of one year (06/13/2023-06/13/2024) using daily adjusted closed prices
4. Uploading to Github repository, utilizing Visual Studio Code, and researching various appropriate libraries for statistical analysis in order to formulate the final product
